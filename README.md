- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mya0220
- ðŸ‘€ I've solved large-scale nonconvex optimization problems, especially in saving energy and optimal scheduling problems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also well-exposed to ML/DL models and interested in merging these tools into an optimization problem and let them help each other.
- âœ¨ I'm currently working as Data Scientist with financial data.
