- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mya0220
- ðŸ‘€ I've solved large-scale nonconvex optimization problems, especially in saving energy and optimal scheduling problems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also well-exposed to heuristic optimization algorithms and a variety of ML/DL methods where the problems can't have exact mathematical models.
- âœ¨ I'm currently working as Data Scientist with financial data.
